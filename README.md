DEA Assignment (Y2S1) - Developing a web application for Phoenix Airline PVT. LTD.
<br><br>

<h1>Scenario</h1><br>
Design and develop a web-based application to manage Airline Service Process for the following requirements but not limited to.
End of December 2019, COVID 19 new virus was found in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The virus has spread globally since its discovery. Like other countries, we are facing many challenges with COVID 19. The number of COVID 19 victims is increasing day by day. Therefore, the public gathering is not so good. In Sri Lanka, most systems are running manually. 
Phoenix Airline PVT is an airline with a small online flight booking system. Other processes, such as user management, flight management, and ticket management, are done manually. Currently, they cannot do them manually. So, they required a website for that. There are three types of users: Staff, Users (client), and Admin. Users and Staff can create their accounts by themself. But Staff accounts must be approved by the admin also the admin can add staff members to the system. 
There are two grades of staff members. Grade one and Grade two. Only Grade one Staff members can update or delete some information. Grade two staff members can view information and only add new flight details. Every activity of the staff and users should be monitored by their ID or email. The admin dashboard can only be accessed by the admin, only staff members can access the staff dashboard, and the user’s (client’s) dashboard can be accessed by users and staff members. Grade One staff members are responsible for adding, updating, deleting flights, checking, updating or deleting ticket information, checking the user's accounts, blocking or updating accounts, and providing information to users via internal chat. Ticket information can be found on the Ticket ID. The admin can monitor every activity of the staff and users. Users can view and filter flights on a particular date and destination point. Users can update their profiles and reservations. The last login time and IP of all users should be monitored. All users can search flights through the flight ID.
You can include more features in addition to those discussed above.
